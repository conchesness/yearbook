This site was made from a template that I give to my Seniors to enable them to get up and running quickly.  
There is some functionality in this site like the calendar that we will likely not use.

ybook.py and user.py are the primary files for the virtual yearbook app.

We will likely use the Feedback feature for feedback on the site?
