This site uses MongoDB.  It would likely be good to switch to Firebase only because I might be able to get it donated 
but that's a horse of a different color. The primary data collections are YBook, Page, User.  Contributor is actually 
embedded within Page and YBook. Need to build out the signature process and can maybe reuse some of the collections 
that are here?
