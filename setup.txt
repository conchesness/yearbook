You need to get set up with two services in order to use this template.  If you are in a group, you can have one 
group member do this.

### Part one: Python Packagess ###

This assumes you have installed Anaconda properly.

Organize your files.  To the left you should see only one level of "2020Capstone-Master".  If you see two levels you need to 
go to the File menu again and choose "Open Folder" and be sure this time that you open the 2020Capstone-Master folder that 
is inside the other 2020Capstone-Master Folder.

Now you need to install all of python packages.  To do this, open the terminal in Visual Studio Code. If it is not
already open then go to the Terminal menu and choose "New Terminal". If the terminal is set to "powershell" pull down the 
terminal menu and choose "select default shell" then pick "Command Prompt" from the menu that opens at the top of your screen. 
Then click the trash can in the terminal window pane and then open a new terminal. Now type the following commands:

conda activate base
pip install -r requirements.txt

You might need to use the --user flag for some packages ie:
pip install --user -r requirements.txt


You should see several packages being downloaded and installed.
You can check to see if it worked by clicking on the main.py to the left and then clicking the play button 
at the top right of the screen.  You want to try and start the app after each stage of the install to see if 
you did it right.

You will need to get the creddentials.json file from Steve Wright which is not in the repository.
